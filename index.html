<h1>Slink LFO</h1>
<p>Developed by Alexander Berg & Michel Iseneld
    A collaboration with Chaos Culture
</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Slink LFO is a modulation source inspired by the movement of water. It’s designed to give fast results while allowing in-depth tweaking for advanced control of your creative projects.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>It uses a rippling algorithm to control the amplitude of 16 modulation outputs, which can be split into 32.
    By tweaking the parameters in the main panel, you change the variables of the algorithm, creating aquatic movements that unfold over time.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>When installing Slink, you are likely to see this prompt:</p>
<img src="#" alt="">

<p>This is normal and means that you are using a newer version of Ableton Live than the installation pack was made in. This does not affect Slink, as it runs on Max. Press “Yes”, and the installation should be executed in a few seconds.</p>

<h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Ableton Live 10</li>
    <li>Max 8.1.6</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Panel</h2>

<p>[Hz] [Sync] sets the movement speed of the pattern that controls the output amplitudes. [Hz] allows you to freely choose a rate, while [Sync] sets a loop length in bars, locked to your project’s tempo.</p>

<p>[Ø] (phase) inverts the current direction of the device’s modulation signal. </p>

<p>[Uni] [Bi] (available in [Hz]-mode) toggles the Frequency knob from uni- to bipolar mode.</p>

<p class="tip">Tip: In bipolar mode, mapping the frequency knob to an external LFO, such as The Spellbook, enables a modulation that changes speed and direction over time.</p>

<ul>
    <li>[trip] (triplet) multiplies the value with 0.666… making it run faster with a more characteristic rhythm. </li>
    <li>[dot] (dotted) multiplies it with 1.5, making it slower.</li>
    <li>[Activating both at the same time multiplies the value with 1.618.</li>
</ul>

<p>[Freeze] pauses the movement of the device.</p>

<p>Frequency/Sync knob changes the speed of the device’s movement. It ranges from 0 to 4 Hz in [Hz]-mode and 1/64 to 32 bars with [Sync].</p>

<p>Multiply & Ripple introduce their own unique character into the movement of Slink. Together they create the waveforms that control the device. </p>


<p>Offset shifts the position in Slink’s movement. This allows you to control it manually or connecting it with an external signal.</p>
<p class="tip">Tip: Set the global Frequency rate to 0 Hz and twist Offset.
    You will notice how it gives you manual control of one cycle.
</p>

<p>Invert attenuates the modulation in two directions. This is sometimes referred to as an attenuverter.</p>

<p>Gravity pulls the algorithm toward the bottom or moves it upward, allowing you to skew your outputs to certain general amplitudes.</p>

<p>Scan alters the algorithm that sends waves through the device. Increasing it introduces new possible variations to the waveform.</p>

<p>Agility smoothens the modulation by making the line behave stiffer.</p>

<p>Slew slows the reaction time of all bands.</p>
